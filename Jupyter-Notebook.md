You can use CogStat in Jupyter Notebook. See a [tutorial here](http://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/blob/master/cogstat/docs/CogStat%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20tutorial.ipynb).

## Information about Jupyter Notebook and Python for beginners

If you don't know [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (aka IPython Notebook), it is a bit like an SPSS output file with the code you can rerun and with your comments. Generally, in Jupyter Notebook, you can analyze your data in [Python computer programming language](https://www.python.org/), while seeing your code, the results (tables, graphs, or even animations), and your comments at the same time in a single document.

When using CogStat in Jupyter Notebook you can enjoy the simple way of running analyses provided by CogStat and repeat the same analysis easily or extend it with other custom Python analysis. For example, it is an ideal tool if you want to repeat the same analysis for several data (e.g., you repeat the experiments several times), a bit similar to the SPSS syntax file, or if you have a complex analysis for which you need some more complex tool, e.g., Python code, and want to make some part of the statistical code more simple with CogStat.

To use CogStat in Jupyter Notebook you have to learn Python programming language. This may sound complicated, but in the beginning, it is easy to write the code if you only use CogStat. Then, if you want to extend your analysis with additional Python code, you can find many tutorials to learn Python for scientific computations.

## Information about CogStat module for Python users

CogStat can be imported and used as any other Python module. One main advantage of using CogStat is that you can run the usually recommended textbook analyses with only a few lines of code. Then, all other advantages of using CogStat apply here: The output is more informative, it builds upon recommended analysis pipelines, and it may reveal essential properties of your data that you wouldn't have checked.
