The user documentation is displayed at https://doc.cogstat.org/. The developer documentation is stored at the [CogStat github Wiki](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/wiki/).

The user documentation should preferably include:
- separate documentation for various releases
- sidebar with the topics
- table of contents of the actual page
- title
- search (in place search is preferred over external (such as Google) search)
- visitor statistics
- date of the last modification of the page

GitHub Pages seems a reasonable solution with Jekyll or Sphinx. As a first implementation, Jekyll is used, as it seems to be simpler to implement.
