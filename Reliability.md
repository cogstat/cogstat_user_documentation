New in v2.4

CogStat supports several reliability analyses.

* If you measured the same property twice and want to find the test-retest reliability, then simply use the [Explore relation of variable pair](Explore-relation-of-variable-pair) analysis.
* If you have several items that constitute an index by summarizing the item scores, and you want to investigate the internal consistency of the measurement, then use the [Internal consistency reliability analysis](Internal-consistency-reliability-analysis).
* If the data of the participants are evaluated by different raters, and you want to check the reliability of the rating process, then use the [Interrater reliability analysis](Interrater-reliability-analysis).
