title: Standardized effect sizes
---
CogStat calculates various standardized effect sizes.

* The effect sizes are differentiated as sample effect sizes and population effect size estimations in the results. (This distinction is not obvious in many textbooks or methodological works.)
* For a single effect, there might be several effect sizes, because they might reflect different aspects of the effect.
* When appropriate, confidence intervals of the population estimations are also provided.
* You might mainly use these effect sizes to describe the effect you investigate, but these effect sizes are also useful in evaluating the [power of the hypothesis tests](Power-analysis).
* Only standardized effect sizes are calculated, but not unstandardized effect sizes, because usually the latter ones can be calculated easily (e.g., the difference of the group means).
