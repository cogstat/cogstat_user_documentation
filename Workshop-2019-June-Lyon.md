**About the workshop** CogStat is an automatic analysis software with carefully designed output to make the interpretation of the results easier and more fluent. The workshop introduces the practical use of the software, and reviews and explains most of the automatically chosen procedures and most of the peculiar features of the output. These procedures and features not only ensure much faster analyses, but they also allow the user to have a fresh look at the analyses results and they offer a more meaningful look at the data.
