At the moment CogStat uses the APA format when it is relevant:

* This mostly means that the results of the hypothesis tests are displayed in line with the APA format.
* Note that the tables are not formatted according to the APA style, because the module CogStat uses to display the results does not support some table formatting.

See [APA style related issues](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/issues/105).
