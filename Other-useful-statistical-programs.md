CogStat is great, we know, but it is not designed for some tasks, some planned features are not available yet, or there may be some special scenarios where individual analysis software should be used. So here is our recommendation for those cases.

General purpose statistical programs
* [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) has maybe the most nicely optimized user interface to run your statistical analyses. We recommend it as a number one option for individual analyses.
* If you need a Bayesian analysis, [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) is the most user-friendly solution to display your results.
* Spreadsheet programs, like [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), are not considered to be main tools for data and statistical analyses, but in fact they are quite powerful, and very useful for large part of the data analysis. [LibreOffice Calc](http://www.libreoffice.org/) is a freely available and efficient spreadsheet software.

Specific statistical tasks
* [GPower](http://www.gpower.hhu.de/) has a comprehensive list of tools for power analysis.
* [Single-case study statistic packages](http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/j.crawford/pages/dept/SingleCaseMethodology.htm) for various conditions by John R Crawford.
* [OpenMeta[analyst]](http://www.cebm.brown.edu/openmeta/) for meta-analysis.

Additional options for general statistical analyses
* [PSPP](https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/) is an SPSS clone, meaning that it intends to be compatible with SPSS, and uses the same commands, and a similar user interface as SPSS. Although it is far from as comprehensive as SPSS, still PSPP could be appropriate for some simple tasks.
* If you don't mind some code writing (e.g., modifying SPSS syntax files),
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/) may be a useful language to run powerful analyses. Plus, [CogStat can be added to your tools](Jupyter-Notebook), too.
    * Or you could try [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with a huge amount of available tools.
    * Also [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), a (mostly) [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) compatible language, can be used.
* See a huge collection at Wikipedia: [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statistical_packages) and [comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_statistical_packages)
