**Date** June 2024, TBA

**Venue** TBA, London, Canada

**About the workshop** The workshop introduces the main ideas behind the diffusion model and its practical use in parameter recovery. The workshop is recommended for researchers and students in behavioral sciences who are not familiar with the diffusion models yet but want to make their first steps and plan to apply these methods in their work. The workshop is led by Attila Krajcsi.

**Schedule of the workshop**
* The main ideas behind the diffusion (and related) models
* The cognitive roles of the parameters
* Parameter recovery and research practice
* Software solutions for parameter recovery
* Parameter recovery with CogStat

**Preparation for the workshop**
* You may download and install [Diffusion Model Visualizer](https://osf.io/4en3b/) and CogStat (preferably use the [latest 2.5RC version](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/releases/tag/2.5rc)) for the workshop.
* You may prepare your own data that you wish to analyze. It should be a paradigm with two possible responses, short (<2000 ms) response latencies, and the log files should be loadable to spreadsheet software.
