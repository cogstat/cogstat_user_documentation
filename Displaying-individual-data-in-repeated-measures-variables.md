title: Displaying individual data in repeated measures variables
---
When displaying individual data in a repeated measures variable, usually it is only the single data points that are drawn. However, there is another essential information in the data: What data points belong to the same individual across the variables. This is essential, because in some cases the difference in the means are not diagnostic about systematic differences. What is diagnostic is whether large part of the sample differs in a similar direction. See an example in Weissgerber et al. (2015):

Therefore, when displaying individual data  in repeated measures variables, it is essential to see how single individuals change across the variables.

## Chosen method in CogStat
When displaying individual data in repeated measures variables, the values of the indiiduals in the neighboring variables are connected.
