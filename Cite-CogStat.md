title: Cite CogStat
---
If you use CogStat for your work, please, cite CogStat in the appropriate publication as

* Krajcsi, A. (2021). CogStat â€“ An automatic analysis statistical software (Version 2.1.0). [Computer software] Retrieved from <https://www.cogstat.org>

Always **specify which version you have used (and use the publication year accordingly)** because improved procedures of later versions may run the analysis differently than the previous versions. (See the :warning: signs in the [release notes](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/blob/master/changelog.md) when something is calculated differently in a new release, and obviously, new procedures introduced in later releases might change the analyses, too.)

Alternatively, you can cite the manuscript describing the considerations behind CogStat:
