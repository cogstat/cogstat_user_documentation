title: Explore relation of variable pair
---
Choose the `Analysis > Explore relation of variable pair` menu or the `Analysis > Explore relation of variables` menu, and choose the variables you want to analyze, then hit OK.

Differences between the `relation of variable pair` and the `relation of variables` menus:
* In the `relation of variable pair` menu, if you choose more than two variables, all possible pairs will be explored. In a variable pair, the first one will be the predictor and the second one is the predicted variable. If you want to have more than one predictor variables, use the `relation of variables menu`.
    * If the two variables in a pair have different measurement level, then lower measurement level will be used for both variables. For example, for an interval-ordinal pair, CogStat handles them if both variables were ordinal.
* In the `relation of variables` menu, you can choose one or more predictor variables. If you want to see the relation of the variable pairs of the chosen set of variables, use the `relation of variable pair` menu.

In the `Display options...` dialog, the [minimum and maximum of the x and y axes](Displaying-the-data-and-results-graphically#range-of-the-axes) can be set.

The analyses can be used for test-retest reliability analysis. See all the other [reliability analyses](Reliability) that are supported by CogStat.

The following values and graphs will be displayed (see also the [common elements of the results](Common-elements-of-the-analysis-results) for more details):

On scatter plots, the size of a dot is proportional with the number of cases with that value pair.
