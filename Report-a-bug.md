title: Report a bug
---
### 1. Make sure it is a bug
Check the appropriate part(s) of the [user documentation](Documentation-for-users) to see whether the thing you consider to be a bug is actually the intended behavior.

### 2. If it is a bug, check if the bug was already reported
You can search some key terms to find whether your bug was already reported on the [Issues page](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/issues) or on the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/discussions).

If you found that your bug has already been reported, you can :+1: the first comment (you need a [free-to-register](https://github.com/join) GitHub account to do this), indicating that the bug also affects you. More votes for the bug mean a faster fix.

### 3. If the bug has not been reported yet, report the bug
You need a [free-to-register](https://github.com/join) GitHub account to report a bug.

If the bug has not been reported yet, then, in the [Issues page](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/issues), click on the New issue button in the upper right corner, or in the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/discussions), click on the New discussion button on the right.
Specify the following pieces of information:
1. What did you want to do?
2. What steps should be followed if someone wants to replicate the bug? This is essential: if we cannot replicate your bug, it can be very hard to fix it.
    * If the bug happens only with a specific data file, attach the file to your bug report. **Ensure that the file does not contain any sensitive data (i.e., personal data of the participants)!**
3. What did happen? What did you expect to happen? If necessary, attach a screenshot.
    * (New in v2.4) In `CogStat > [Preferences](Preferences)`, set `Detailed error message` on. With this [setting](Preferences#detailed-error-message), CogStat prints a more detailed error message on the Results pane when the analysis cannot be run. Copy the detailed error message to your error report. Remove any sensitive information that may refer to your data.
4. Specify your system by going to the `CogStat > Diagnosis information` menu and paste the output of the command to your bug report. Optionally delete sensitive data from your diagnosis information (probably your path).
