## Language

Set the language of CogStat.

In some languages, some texts may be shown in English, when the given text has not been translated yet. ([See the percentage next to the language in the to be released version of CogStat](https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=38161).)

If you want to use a language that not available yet, or if you want to improve the current version of your chosen language, join us to [translate CogStat](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/wiki/Translation).

## Chart theme

(From version 2.4, CogStat doesn't have to be restarted to apply the new theme.)

Set the look of the [charts](Displaying-the-data-and-results-graphically#chart-theme).


## Image format

(New in v2.4)

Choose an [image format](Displaying-the-data-and-results-graphically#image-format) (png or svg) to be used for charts.

## Detailed error message

(New in v2.4)

A detailed error message can be turned on or off, which is displayed when CogStat cannot perform a task.

For [error reporting](Report-a-bug), with the detailed error messages you can send more detailed information to the developers when CogStat does not work the way it is supposed to be.
