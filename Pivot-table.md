With pivot table data of a dependent variable can be grouped by other variable(s) values and the groups can be processed by different functions.

To create a pivot table, from the `Analysis` menu choose `Pivot table`, and choose the variable(s) you want to analyze:
* Set the dependent variable.
* Set one or more independent variables. Any grouping variables can be used to group the dependent data by pages, rows and columns.
* Set the function to apply for the grouped dependent variable.
    * Currently the following functions are available: N, Sum, Mean, [Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), [Lower quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile), Upper quartile, [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation), [Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance).

Generally, spreadsheet programs can handle pivot tables more flexibly, and it may be a good idea to use them for pivots, although some functions are not available in them, when CogStat may be a better choice.
